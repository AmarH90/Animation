                    Aliens have not been discovered in South America after all. The doll-like figures, photos of which went viral online last year, are just that – dolls, according to scientists.
                    The controversial artifacts were seized by Peruvian customs agents in October and intended for "a Mexican citizen," the Associated Press reported. 
                    Mexican journalist and self-described "UFOlogist" Jaime Maussan brought similar unidentified fraudulent objects in front of the Mexican congress last September, claiming that they had been recovered near Peru's ancient Nazca Lines and dated over 700 years old.</p>

                    NASA released a new report on UFOs — also known as unidentified anomalous phenomena — on Thursday. The report examines how the space agency can better contribute to the scientific understanding of the objects.

                    NASA UAP report finds no evidence of "extraterrestrial" UFOs, but some encounters still defy explanation
                    By Stefan Becket

                    Washington — An independent group of scientist and experts convened by NASA found no evidence that unidentified anomalous phenomena, known as UAPs or UFOs, are "extraterrestrial" in nature, but stressed that better data is needed to understand some encounters that have defied explanation.
                    NASA formed the group of 16 experts last year to examine how the space agency can better contribute to the scientific understanding of the objects, which have been reported by hundreds of military and commercial pilots. 
                    On Thursday evening NASA announced that they were appointing Mark McInerney as its director of UAP research in an updated news statement. McInerney will "centralize communications, resources, and data analytical capabilities to establish a robust database for the evaluation of future UAP."
                    Formally known as the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study, the group issued its final 36-page report on Thursday, with several recommendations about how the space agency can use its scientific expertise to contribute to the government's investigations into the objects. 
                    "The top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn," NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at a briefing about the findings. "The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin. But we don't know what these UAP are."

                <p>By Tucker Reals, Stefan Becket Updated on: September 15, 2023 / 4:28 AM EDT / CBS News A journalist and researcher on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), or UFOs as they're better known, presented the remains of purported "non-human" beings to lawmakers in Mexico on Tuesday during the country's first public congressional hearing on the topic. Jamie Maussan brought two boxes containing what he said were the small, stuffed bodies of extraterrestrials recovered in Peru in 2017. He said carbon-14 dating carried out by the National Autonomous University of Mexico had determined the remains were 700 and 1,800 years old. Each of the figures has only three fingers on each hand and elongated heads, resembling, at least superficially, the Hollywood-born character ET.</p>
